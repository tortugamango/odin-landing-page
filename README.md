## Overview

This assignment <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page" target="blank_">Project: Landing page</a> was set as part of the<a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/"> The Odin Project</a> curriculum. This is a very basic landing page using a flexbox layout.

## Objectives

1. Download the design images provided. Image One shows the full design. Image Two displays the color and fonts used.

2. Hero text refers to the prominent statement at the top of a web page.

3. Break down the project into manageable parts. The website has 4 main sections and a footer, so focus on building one section at a time.

4. Start from the top of the page and work your way down to maintain structure and flow.

5. For each section, first add all the content using HTML before starting any CSS styling.

6. Once the HTML for a section is complete, begin styling it using CSS. You can adjust the HTML later if needed, but avoid switching back and forth too early.

7. Use only one CSS stylesheet for the entire project. There is no need to split styles across multiple files.

8. Many of the design elements are similar to those used in your flexbox exercises. Revisit those exercises if needed.

9. Do not worry about making the project look good on mobile devices. That will be covered later.

10. When you finish, push your completed project to GitHub.
